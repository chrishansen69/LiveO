LiveO is a 3D model editor for [Need for Madness](http://www.needformadness.com) and [Radical Aces](http://www.radicalplay.com/radicalaces/)' [RAD 3D Engine](http://www.needformadness.com/developer/extras.html). It was originally developed by [Omar Waly](http://www.radicalplay.com/about/) to create aircraft for Radical Aces but was then re-used for Need for Madness.
After the release of Need for Madness 2 the tool was given to the public and development continued.  
This version of LiveO was modified by [ApexNova](http://aimgames.forummotion.com/u1866) and [Kaffeinated](http://aimgames.forummotion.com/u2228) ([Github profile](https://github.com/HulaSamsquanch)) and I ([uwx](https://github.com/uwx)) took over development from [`b71f270`](https://github.com/uwx/LiveO/commit/b71f2704dd3f951e06583b0e27ea9703e560a48e) afterwards.
